![alt tag](https://travis-ci.org/stevendobay/org.suit.svg)

An API bridge for Scala to use Java's Swing library easier and to create gui-based applications faster with rich client components. It introduces some other components from libraries an unifies those here.
The library has been published with [LGPL v3.0 license](https://github.com/stevendobay/org.suit/blob/master/LICENSE).
For examples look at [the test classes](https://github.com/stevendobay/org.suit/tree/master/src/test/scala).
