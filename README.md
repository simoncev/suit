# Welcome to suit - Scala User Interface Terminals 0.10.4 !

![alt tag](https://travis-ci.org/stevendobay/suit.svg)

An API bridge for Scala to use Java's swing library and others far easier and to create gui-based applications 
faster with rich client components. It introduces some other components from libraries and connects those here.
The target platforms for now are desktops but android- and browser supports could come soon. 
The library has been published with [LGPL v3.0 license](https://github.com/stevendobay/suit/blob/master/LICENSE).
For examples look at [the test classes](https://github.com/stevendobay/suit/tree/master/src/test/scala).
